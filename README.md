endora
------
`endora` is a pandora-esque music recommendation engine that gives you your own
tailor-made radio station. The program uses the magic powers of my
[sensation](http://github.com/s714726/sensation/) Scala client for the Echo Nest
developer API.

Named after Endora, famed stepmother of Darrin Stephens on *Bewitched*. She uses
her powers to torment Darrin by giving him music recommendations but not
providing him with any actual music.

Usage
-----
TODO: Include instructions for including the sensation jar in the classpath and
an Echo Nest key as an environment variable

After each song, tell `endora` how you like it or
what you did with it (favorite, ban, skip, or just plain old listen), and endora
will alter the behavior of your station accordingly.

And to reiterate: this program only hands out recommendations. **Music not included**
